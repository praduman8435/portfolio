# Praduman Prajapati - Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! 🎨🚀  
[Check it out here!](https://thexro.vercel.app/)

This website is my first attempt at creating a sleek, modern portfolio with smooth animations, built using **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** and various **npm packages**. My goal was to create something visually striking, fast, and responsive.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Sass
- **Animation**: GSAP (GreenSock)
- **Bundler**: Vite
- **Deployment**: Deployed on Vercel
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
